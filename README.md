Some dotfiles things I want to remember.

# zsh

The `zsh` directory is some setup from trying out **oh-my-zsh**. I'm
sort of digging it. There is a basic *rc file and then my own tweaks
to the basic robby theme (basically adding more subdirectories to the
prompt). I think the danger is getting too big of a prompt.
